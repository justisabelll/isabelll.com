In order to achieve most things in life you have to be undeniable. It is the only thing you can be, besides lucky.

There will _always_ be people, ideas, basis, systems, and even statistics against you. Against your success, against your happiness. Against the very _idea_ of you. This is unequivocally true. Anything or persons that suggest otherwise are either ignorant, or part of that which are against you.

You should not be afraid to acknowledge this adversity, no matter what part of your background it might come from. Use it as an everlasting source of motivation.

Be too good to overlook.
Be too good to forget.
Be too good to fail.
Be too good to lose.
Be too good to be wrong.
Be too good to be denied.

This is an undue burden. Have the utmost compassion for anyone who rightfully rejects it.

It is also no guarantee of anything.

Nevertheless, undeniable is how I will present myself to my adversities.
Undeniable is what I will be, and the world will be to me.
